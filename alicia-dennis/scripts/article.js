// COMMENT: What is the purpose of the following function? Why is its name capitalized? Explain the context of "this" within the function. What does "rawDataObj" represent?
//The function is a constructor which calls the object rawDataObj and passes it through the function to display a particular instance of the Article. It is capitalized as you should only capitalize the first character of the name of a function when you need to construct the object by "new" keyword and don't mistake it for a class or element. "this" within a function grabs a particular instance within the constructor function. rawDataObj represents the entire data array as a block.

  // TODO: Use the JS object that is passed in to complete this constructor function:
  this.rawDataObj=rawDataObj;
  this.title=rawDataObj.title;
  this.category=rawDataObj.category;
  this.author=rawDataObj.author;
  this.authorUrl=rawDataObj.authorUrl;
  this.publishedOn=rawDataObj.publishedOn;
  this.body=rawDataObj.body;

In our modules.css stylesheet, we should give all elements with a class of template a display of none so that our template does not display in the browser.

}

}

//take in each index of some array and push through some object. grab raw data one at a time and push through new article. We will create a new array of articles with objects inside. We will grab a new element in last for loop, an id of articles (from html file), this is going to exist in the DOM, we are dot appending. We arent grabbing the array article instead we are running the toHTML method and we are appending the result/return of that method. Will return new article. Runs 30 times (find id and append new article). 1st for loop calls constructor, second calls toHtml method.
