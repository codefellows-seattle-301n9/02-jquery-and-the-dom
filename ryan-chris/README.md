## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

We are building a mobile friendly blog application called Kilovolt Blog. This blog is built mobile first and features images and text content covering various topics, with links to social media and features from multiple contributing authors.
This blog features the ability to upload new content to the web page using jQuery.

## Getting Started

Download jQuery CDN, link normalize.css file from MeyersWeb, add SMACSS files (base, layout, modules), and link js files with scripts to render content to the page. 

## Architecture

This application was designed with HTML5 and CSS3 with a mobile first design approach, implamenting SMACSS guidelines for styling and responsive webdesign techniques to improve user experience. The page will become more dynamic by uploading content to the pager using jQuery.
