#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Alicia and Dennis paired together. It took about 6 hours**
#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on was creating JS Objects by using ‘this’
  2. Next, we cloned the articles and removed the template class so it wouldn’t repeat (infinite loop)
  3. Then after we created the newArticle and put all of the information into it, we needed to find the property data within the array and put the proper iteration of the information into it.
  4. Then we refactored the loops by using ‘forEach’
